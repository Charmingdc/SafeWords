# **SafeWords: Secure Your Text Messages!** üõ°Ô∏è

SafeWords is a modern, intuitive web application meticulously crafted with React and TypeScript, designed to provide a secure and straightforward way to encrypt and decrypt sensitive text data directly in your browser. Leveraging the powerful Web Cryptography API (SubtleCrypto) for robust AES-GCM encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation, this project ensures your information remains confidential and accessible only to those with the correct password. Say goodbye to insecure plain text and embrace a new era of digital privacy! ‚ú®

## üí° Usage

SafeWords provides a user-friendly interface for both encrypting and decrypting text.

### Encrypting Your Data
1.  **Select "Encryption"**: On the homepage, ensure the "Encryption" option is selected.
2.  **Enter Text**: Type or paste the text you wish to encrypt into the large text area.
3.  **Set a Password**: In the input field below, enter a strong password. Remember this password, as it will be required for decryption!
4.  **Secure Your Data**: Click the "SECURE" button. A modal will appear displaying your encrypted text and the password you used.
5.  **Copy and Store**: Use the "Copy" button to easily copy the encrypted string to your clipboard. You should store this string and the password securely.

### Decrypting Your Data
1.  **Select "Decryption"**: Switch to the "Decryption" option on the homepage.
2.  **Paste Encrypted Data**: Paste your previously encrypted string into the large text area.
3.  **Enter Password**: Provide the exact password that was used during the encryption process in the password input field.
4.  **Access Your Data**: Click the "ACCESS" button. If the password is correct, a modal will display your original decrypted text.
5.  **Copy Decrypted Text**: You can copy the decrypted text to your clipboard using the provided button.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Robust Encryption/Decryption**: Implements AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois/Counter Mode) for strong symmetric encryption, utilizing PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) for secure key derivation from user-provided passwords.
*   **Intuitive User Interface**: A clean, modern, and responsive design built with Tailwind CSS, offering a seamless experience for both encryption and decryption operations.
*   **Clipboard Integration**: Effortlessly copy encrypted or decrypted results to your clipboard with a single click, enhancing user convenience.
*   **Dynamic Theming**: Supports both light and dark modes, automatically adapting to system preferences or allowing users to toggle themes manually for a personalized experience.
*   **Input Validation**: Ensures that both the text data and a password are provided before any cryptographic operation is performed, preventing common errors and guiding the user.
*   **Secure Password Handling**: Passwords are never stored directly; instead, they are used to derive cryptographic keys via PBKDF2 with high iteration counts, significantly enhancing security against brute-force attacks.
*   **Future-Ready Architecture**: Built with Vite and TypeScript, providing an extremely fast development experience, robust type safety, and a scalable project structure.
*   **Saved Entries Management (Planned)**: An initial UI for viewing saved entries is in place, demonstrating a future feature to persist and manage encrypted data locally.
