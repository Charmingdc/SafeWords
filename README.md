# **SafeWords: Your Private Text Encryption & Decryption Tool üîí**

Protect your sensitive information with **SafeWords** ‚Äì a robust, client-side encryption and decryption tool that ensures your data never leaves your browser. üöÄ Seamlessly encrypt any text with a strong password, generating a secure Base64-encoded string. Share it anywhere, knowing that only someone with the correct password can unlock its contents. Ideal for secure notes, confidential messages, or developer secrets. Your privacy, our priority! ‚ú®

## üöÄ Installation

Getting SafeWords up and running on your local machine is straightforward. Follow these steps to set up the development environment:

*   **1. Clone the Repository:**
Start by cloning the project to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Charmingdc/SafeWords
cd SafeWords
```

*   **2. Install Dependencies:**
Navigate into the project directory and install all required dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

*   **3. Start the Development Server:**
Once dependencies are installed, you can launch the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This command will start the application, typically accessible at `http://localhost:5173/` in your web browser.

*   **4. Build for Production (Optional):**
To create a production-ready build of the application, run:

```bash
npm run build
```
This will generate optimized static assets in the `dist` directory.

## üìù Usage

SafeWords is designed for intuitive and secure text handling. Here‚Äôs how you can use it to encrypt and decrypt your information:

1.  **Access the Application:**
After starting the development server, navigate to `http://localhost:5173/` (or the appropriate URL) in your web browser. You'll land on the introductory page. Click the "Get Started" button to proceed to the main encryption/decryption interface.

2.  **Choose Your Operation:**
On the main page, you'll see two buttons: "Encryption" and "Decryption".
*   Select **Encryption** if you want to secure new text.
*   Select **Decryption** if you have an encrypted message you wish to reveal.

3.  **Input Your Data and Password:**
*   **Text Area:** Depending on your chosen operation, enter or paste the plain text you wish to encrypt, or the Base64-encoded encrypted string you want to decrypt.
*   **Password Field:** Input a strong, memorable password. This password is crucial for both encrypting and decrypting your data, so ensure it's kept private and secure. For decryption, you must use the exact password that was originally used for encryption.

4.  **Perform the Operation:**
Once you've entered both your text/data and the password, click the prominent button at the bottom (which will display "SECURE" for encryption or "ACCESS" for decryption).

5.  **View and Manage Your Output:**
*   **Output Modal:** A modal will appear displaying your encrypted Base64 string (for encryption) or your decrypted plain text (for decryption).
*   **Copy to Clipboard:** Use the "Copy" button to quickly copy the output to your clipboard for sharing or further use.
*   **Save Encryptions (Encryption Only):** If you've encrypted text, you'll have an option to "Save" the encrypted output along with its password to your browser's local IndexedDB storage. This is stored entirely client-side, ensuring privacy.
*   **Close Modal:** Click "Close" to dismiss the output modal.

6.  **View Saved Encryptions:**
On the main application page, you can click the "View Saved Encryptions" button. This will open a modal displaying all entries you've previously saved. You can then click on individual entries to view their full content and password, copy them, or delete them from your local storage.
